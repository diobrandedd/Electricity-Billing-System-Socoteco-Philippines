# Priority Number Generator System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive priority number generator system for your SOCOTECO II electricity bill management system. The system provides strict first-come, first-serve queue management with real-time display capabilities and a daily capacity limit of 1,000 customers.

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Database Structure ✅
- **priority_numbers** - Stores all priority numbers with customer info and status
- **priority_queue_status** - Tracks current queue status and daily statistics  
- **service_days** - Manages service day capacity and availability
- **priority_number_history** - Complete audit trail for all actions
- **system_settings** - Configuration parameters for the priority system

### 2. Core System Class ✅
- **PriorityNumberGenerator.php** - Main class handling all priority number operations
- Strict first-come, first-serve logic
- Automatic service day assignment based on daily capacity
- Queue management and statistics
- Customer validation and duplicate prevention

### 3. User Interfaces ✅

#### Customer Interface (`priority_number_generator.php`)
- Generate priority numbers with optional preferred dates
- View current queue status and statistics
- Check priority number history
- Cancel priority numbers if needed
- Real-time queue display

#### Admin Interface (`priority_queue_management.php`)
- Manage current priority number being served
- View upcoming customers and queue statistics
- Serve customers and update queue status
- Skip numbers and handle exceptions
- Export queue reports

#### Real-time Display (`priority_display.php`)
- Public display for service centers
- Shows current priority number being served
- Live statistics and upcoming numbers
- Auto-refreshes every 10 seconds
- Beautiful, responsive design

#### Settings Panel (`priority_settings.php`)
- Configure daily capacity (default: 1,000)
- Set advance booking days (default: 7)
- Configure expiry hours (default: 24)
- Enable/disable notifications and weekend service
- System maintenance tools

### 4. AJAX API Endpoints ✅
- **priority_number.php** - Complete API for all priority operations
- **priority_display.php** - Real-time display data endpoint
- Secure with CSRF protection and role-based access
- Comprehensive error handling

### 5. Installation & Setup ✅
- **setup_priority_system.php** - Automated installation wizard
- **priority_system.sql** - Database schema and initial data
- System requirements checking
- One-click installation process

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Strict First-Come, First-Serve
- Sequential priority number generation
- No jumping the queue
- Automatic service day assignment based on position

### ✅ Daily Capacity Management

- Statistics and reporting
- Exception handling (skip numbers, etc.)

### ✅ System Administration
- Configurable settings
- System maintenance tools
- Audit trail and logging
- Performance optimization

## How It Works

### Priority Number Generation
1. Customer requests priority number
2. System validates customer and checks for existing numbers
3. Assigns next sequential priority number
4. Calculates service date based on daily capacity
5. Stores priority number with customer info
6. Updates service day capacity

### Queue Management
1. Staff updates current serving number
2. System marks priority number as served
3. Updates queue statistics
4. Real-time display updates automatically
5. Next customer in queue becomes current

### Service Day Assignment
- Priority numbers 1-1000 → Day 1
- Priority numbers 1001-2000 → Day 2
- Priority numbers 2001-3000 → Day 3
- And so on...

## Installation Instructions

### Quick Setup
1. **Run the setup script**: Navigate to `setup_priority_system.php`
2. **Follow the wizard**: Complete the installation process
3. **Configure settings**: Go to `priority_settings.php` to adjust parameters
4. **Start using**: Access the system through the provided interfaces

### Manual Setup
1. **Import database**: Run `database/priority_system.sql`
2. **Configure settings**: Update system_settings table
3. **Set permissions**: Ensure proper file permissions
4. **Test system**: Verify all components work correctly

## Access Points

### For Customers
- **Generate Priority**: `priority_number_generator.php`
- **View Display**: `priority_display.php`

### For Staff
- **Manage Queue**: `priority_queue_management.php`
